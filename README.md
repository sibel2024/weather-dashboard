# Weather Dashboard
This is a web application that allows you to search for weather information by entering the name of a city. When you type a city name into the input field and submit it, 
the app fetches the current weather details using a weather API. It then displays the temperature, humidity, and weather conditions (like sunny, cloudy, or rainy) on the webpage, along with an icon representing the weather. If the city can't be found or there's an issue with the API, the app will show an error message.

# Languages and Frameworks Used
This project uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a simple web application that allows users to search for weather information by city name. 
The application leverages the Fetch API to retrieve weather data from a public weather API like OpenWeatherMap. Asynchronous JavaScript with async/await is used to handle API requests,and basic CSS is applied for styling the dashboard.
