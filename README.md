# Weather Dashboard
## Introduction
This is a web application that allows you to search for weather information by entering the name of a city. When you type a city name into the input field and submit it, 
the app fetches the current weather details using a weather API. It then displays the temperature, humidity, and weather conditions (like sunny, cloudy, or rainy) on the webpage. If the city can't be found or there's an issue with the API, the app will show an error message.
